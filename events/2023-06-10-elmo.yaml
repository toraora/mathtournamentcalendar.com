  The ELMO is an olympiad test similar to both the USAMO and IMO in format. It
  is written, administered, and graded by returning MOPers for those attending
  MOP for the first time. However, because there are only finitely many people
  who can attend MOP each year, for many years the competition has also been
  posted and run on AoPS.
